In certain cases we need to check for multiple possible value options, for example if a user's name shows up IN a list of know names.
For this we can use multiple OR operator or IN Keyword. .  
We can use the IN operator to create a condition that checks to see if a value is included in the list of multiple options.

SYNTAX

value IN (option_1,option_2,option_3....option_n)


We can use NOT IN as well. 


Example

return all the rows for the payments in 0.99, 1.98 and 1.99

SELECT * FROM payment
WHERE amount IN (0.99,1.98,1.99);


COUNT

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment
WHERE amount IN (0.99,1.98,1.99);

Outside this range

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment
WHERE amount NOT IN (0.99,1.98,1.99);


Using string

SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE first_name IN ('John', 'Jake', 'Julie');
